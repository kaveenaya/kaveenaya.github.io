        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>The very first coding experience I had was with html, building web pages.
            Web development is what got me interested in programming so it feels
            nice to be back using html. I did not really have any struggles with the 
            coding component of this assignment because the professor explained html 
            basics really well, and I already had some basic html knowledge as well
            so I did not have any struggles with the assignment.
