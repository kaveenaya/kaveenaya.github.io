        <p>
            The Sri Lankan Civil War was fought between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, which lasted for nearly three decades. Sri Lanka is made up of two main ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, with Sinhalese being the majority. One of the central factors that fueled this war was the ethnic tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese communities. Therefore, the research question I have been focusing on this term was “How did the ethnic tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese build up leading to the war?”. The tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese had deep historical roots and was exacerbated by a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors. And this project aims to explore the causes of the ethnic tension that led to the Sri Lankan Civil War, focusing on historical developments, political dynamics, and socio-economic factors.

                    I chose to research the Sri Lankan Civil War because despite being a major war affecting an ethnicity, this war has not received as much attention as the other wars in recent times from the rest of the world. The Sri Lankan Civil War was devastating, leaving a profound impact on the nation's social, economic, and political fabric. Moreover, I am a Tamil-speaking Indian, and this war affected and continues to affect a large population of Tamils, so this war is very close to my heart as well. I have grown up hearing stories of this war, and it has always hurt me knowing that there were Tamil people, like me, who went through all the discrimination and had to find refuge in other countries just for being Tamil. Although I have always known about the Sri Lankan War, I did not know as much as I hoped I had. So, I saw this project as an opportunity to start my research journey on what really happened in the Sri Lankan Civil War.

	                To really understand the roots of ethnic tension between Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, it is essential to delve into the origin and colonial history of the nation. Sri Lanka has a rich and diverse history shaped by various external influences. It is believed that the Sinhalese arrived on the island from Northern India, but the reason remains ambiguous [8]. Although the Sinhalese have been in contact with the Tamils from Southern India since at least the second century BCE, the Tamils only arrived on the island as invaders and traders from India’s Chola Kingdom between the seventh and 11th centuries CE [1]. Similar to the other South Asian nations, Great Britain also ruled Sri Lanka, dating from 1815 to 1948. The arrival of the British had a profound impact on the island's socio-political landscape. The British colonial administration implemented policies that exacerbated ethnic divisions, favoring the Sinhalese in certain aspects and the Tamils in others. For example, the British established huge cash crop plantations on the island, and they brought in approximately a million Tamil speakers from India to work as plantation laborers. Moreover, The British predominantly established English language schools in the Tamil-dominated northern region of the nation. These situations resulted in the British providing Tamils with more professional opportunities than the Sinhalese [1][8]. This repeated British favoritism towards the Tamils angered and led the Sinhalese majority to feel oppressed. In the article ThoughtCo, Kallie Szczepanski states, "This was a common divide-and-rule tactic in European colonies that had troubling results in the post-colonial era in places such as Rwanda and Sudan." [8]. Similar to what happened in Rwanda between the Tutsis and Hutus, we can see that the British's imperial rule played a major role in provoking the ethnic tension between these two groups, leading up to the conflict. However, this pattern of Tamil dominance did not last long. Soon after the British left the island in 1948, the socio-political landscape changed dramatically. [1].

                    Sri Lanka gained independence from British rule in 1948, and the post-independence era witnessed the crystallization of ethnic tensions. Post-independence, the Sinhalese rose in power through their dominant population and immediately began passing laws disenfranchising the Tamil population. One such instance was the Sinhala Only Act in 1956. This Act established Sinhala as the only official language of the nation, creating barriers for the Tamil-speaking population from attaining government employment opportunities [1]. In the Harvard International Review, Nithyani Anandakugan states, "Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga frames the act, which her father passed, as a move to nurture and reclaim a Sri Lankan identity following an extended period of British rule." [1]. Although this statement implies the intention behind this act was to uplift the dignity of the Sinhalese people post-British rule, what it really accomplished was marginalizing the Tamil language and exacerbating feelings of exclusion among the Tamil population. Another such Tamil discriminative act was the  Standardization policy in 1971. While this policy was established to give more academic opportunities for disadvantaged Sinhalese students, it required Tamil students to get higher scores to get into the same universities [1]. This deprived many Tamil students of proper education, especially the students who turned to education to compensate for their lack of professional civil service opportunities caused by the Sinhala Only Act. Although these acts had more to do with reclaiming the Sinhalese power than developing tension with the Tamils, they led to a gradual radicalization of Tamil political aspirations.
