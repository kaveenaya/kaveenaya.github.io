        <h2>About Me:</h2>

        <h3>Name:</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Kaveenaya Srinivasagam Omkumar but I prefer to be 
            called Kaveenaya (she/her).
        </p>

        <h3>Major:</h3>
        <p>Computer Science</p>

        <h3>Year Of Study:</h3>
        <p>1'st year student at Oregon State.</p>

        <h3>My Web Development Experience:</h3>
        <p>
            I took web design as an elective class at my high school 
            during my freshman year. In that class we learned basic html 
            and css, and the most complex project we did was make an 
            website which links to multiple pages. So I only have very 
            basic web development skills and very few experience so far.
        </p>

        <h3>My Goal For This Class:</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to develop more advanced web development skills to be 
            able to create complex and interative web pages.
