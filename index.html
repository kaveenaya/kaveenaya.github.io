            The Sri Lankan Civil War was fought between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, which lasted for nearly three decades, from 1983 to 2009. Sri Lanka is made up of two main ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, with Sinhalese being the majority. One of the central factors that fueled this war was the ethnic tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese communities. Therefore, the research question I have been focusing on this term was “How did the ethnic tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese build up leading to the war?”. The tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese had deep historical roots and was exacerbated by a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors. And this project aims to explore the causes of the ethnic tension that led to the Sri Lankan Civil War, focusing on historical developments, political dynamics, and socio-economic factors.

                <p>
                    I chose to research the Sri Lankan Civil War because despite being a major war affecting a whole ethnic group and leaving a profound impact on the nation's social, economic, and political fabric, this war has not received as much attention as the other wars in recent times from the rest of the world. Although the war occurred between the Sri Lankan government and LTTE, the Sri Lankan government did not hesitate to target the Tamil civilians as well. Even today, over 1/4 of the Sri Lankan Tamil population lives outside of Sri Lanka due to the war in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and India [2]. Some of the Sri Lankan Tamils still remain missing today. For example, in the video above, we hear from many different women who are still searching and protesting for their missing husband or son from the war 13 years ago [5]. It shows that the wounds from the war are still deeply ingrained in the affected Tamils, and only time will tell if they will ever heal. So, I was hoping that through my research, I would at least be able to spread awareness of the Sri Lankan Tamils to a couple of my classmates. Moreover, I am a Tamil-speaking Indian, and this war affected and continues to affect a large population of Tamils, so this war is very close to my heart as well. I have grown up hearing stories of this war, and it has always hurt me knowing that there were Tamil people, like me, who went through all the discrimination and had to find refuge in other countries just for being Tamil. Although I have always known about the Sri Lankan War, I did not know as many details about it as I had hoped. So, I saw this project as an opportunity to start my research journey on what really happened between the Tamils and Sinhalese in the Sri Lankan Civil War. The research question, “How did the ethnic tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese build up leading to the war?” seemed like the best way to start my research as it gives a good background on the situation between the two groups before the war, and leads to the actual war.

                    To really understand the roots of ethnic tension between Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, it is essential to delve into the origin and colonial history of the nation. Sri Lanka has a rich and diverse history shaped by various external influences. It is believed that the Sinhalese arrived on the island from Northern India, but the reason remains ambiguous [8]. Although the Sinhalese have been in contact with the Tamils from Southern India since at least the second century BCE, the Tamils only arrived on the island as invaders and traders from India’s Chola Kingdom between the seventh and 11th centuries CE [1]. Similar to the other South Asian nations, Great Britain also ruled Sri Lanka, dating from 1815 to 1948. The arrival of the British had a profound impact on the island's socio-political landscape. The British colonial administration implemented policies that exacerbated ethnic divisions, favoring the Sinhalese in certain aspects and the Tamils in others. For example, the British established huge cash crop plantations on the island, and they brought in approximately a million Tamil speakers from India to work as plantation laborers. Moreover, The British predominantly established English language schools in the Tamil-dominated northern region of the nation. These situations resulted in the British providing Tamils with more professional opportunities than the Sinhalese [1][8]. This repeated British favoritism towards the Tamils angered and led the Sinhalese majority to feel oppressed. In the article ThoughtCo, Kallie Szczepanski states, "This was a common divide-and-rule tactic in European colonies that had troubling results in the post-colonial era in places such as Rwanda and Sudan." [8]. This is a very important statement to note. Similar to what happened in Rwanda between the Tutsis and Hutus, where the British favored one group over the other, resulting in a civil war post-independence, we can see that the British's favoritism during their imperial rule played a major role in provoking the ethnic tension between these the Tamils and Sinhalese, leading up to the Sri Lankan Civil War. However, this pattern of Tamil dominance did not last long. Soon after the British left the island in 1948, the socio-political landscape changed dramatically [1].

                    Sri Lanka gained independence from British rule in 1948, and the post-independence era witnessed the crystallization of ethnic tensions. Post-independence, the Sinhalese rose in power through their dominant population and immediately began passing laws disenfranchising the Tamil population. One such instance was the Sinhala Only Act in 1956. This Act established Sinhala as the only official language of the nation, creating barriers for the Tamil-speaking population from attaining government employment opportunities [1][2]. In the Harvard International Review, Nithyani Anandakugan states, "Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga frames the act, which her father passed, as a move to nurture and reclaim a Sri Lankan identity following an extended period of British rule." [1]. Although this statement implies the intention behind this act was purely to uplift the dignity of the oppressed Sinhalese people post-British rule, what it really accomplished was marginalizing the Tamil language and exacerbating feelings of exclusion among the Tamil population. Another such Tamil discriminative act was the Standardization policy in 1971. While this policy was established to give more academic opportunities for disadvantaged Sinhalese students, it required Tamil students to get higher scores to get into the same universities [1]. This deprived many Tamil students of proper education, especially the students who turned to education to compensate for their lack of professional civil service opportunities caused by the Sinhala Only Act. Although these acts had more to do with reclaiming the Sinhalese power rather than developing tension with the Tamils, they discriminated against the Tamils, leading to a gradual radicalization of Tamil political aspirations [2].

                    Watching the Sri Lankan government betray the Tamil population, the Tamils, feeling disenfranchised and marginalized, began to demand equal rights and recognition of their cultural and linguistic identity. The Tamil people tried non-violent protest led by the activist Chelvanayakam, a Gandhi follower, post the Sinhala Only Act. Unfortunately, it was returned with violence from the Sinhalese, leading to the Anti-Tamil riots of 1956, resulting in widespread violence, displacement, and loss of life [7]. This event, often referred to as Black July, marked a turning point in the conflict, pushing the Tamil struggle for autonomy toward a more militant and separatist direction. The brutal suppression of the Tamil population during these riots fueled a sense of grievance and deepened the mistrust between the two communities. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, was formed. LTTE is a Tamil militant organization composed of Tamil youths who were dissatisfied with the Sri Lankan government and Tamil leaders led by Velupillai Prabhakaran advocating for an independent Tamil state known as Tamil Eelam in Tamil-dominated Northern and Eastern part of the nation due to the continuous Tamil discrimination but the Sri Lankan government opposed [1]. The LTTE is most widely known as a terrorist group as they employed guerrilla tactics and engaged in acts of terrorism to fund their activities [3]. However, it is important to note that the Sinhalese and the Sri Lankan government were the first to use violence. The major event that caused the ethnic tension between the two groups to burst before the war was in 1983 when the LTTE ambushed an army coney and killed 13 soldiers. To respond, the Sinhalese retaliated with violence, where over 2,500 Tamils died in ethnic riots [8]. This resulted in a cycle of violence on both sides. The newspaper above lists the series of attacks both parties made on each other for "tit-for-tat" post this event, resulting in separating the two groups even more and marking the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War. [4][7].

                    The ethnic tension between the Tamils and Sinhalese that led to the Sri Lankan Civil War was a complex interplay of historical, political, economic, and social factors. While the conflict officially ended in 2009 with the defeat of the LTTE, the scars remain, and the need for reconciliation, justice, and inclusive governance persists. The Sri Lankan Civil War serves as a poignant reminder of the destructive consequences of unresolved ethnic tensions. While researching this war, I could not help but reminded of Jervis's chapter on War and Misperception. In this chapter, Jervis argues that although war can happen when both sides see each other accurately, misperception often plays a large role [6]. I agree with Jervis and think misperception played a huge role in the root conflict between Tamils and Sinhalese as well. The conflict between the Tamils and Sinhalese began during the British's imperial rule due to their favoritism towards the Tamils, making Sinhalese feel oppressed and hatred towards the Tamils. But I believe the Sinhalese forgot about the role the British played and ended up blaming the Tamils when it was really the British who made the Sinhalese feel oppressed by their favoritism and not the Tamils. Because of the misperception, Sinhalese began discriminating against the Tamils to show the dominance they did not have during the British's imperial rule, causing the start of a civil war. This leads me to believe that one of the main reasons why this war happened, and the answer to our class is because of misperception. The cause of war is definitely a combination of various factors, but we can not deny the huge role misperception plays. I want to conclude this project by saying this research is very close to my heart, so I will continue my research on this war. Moving forward, I will begin focusing on the time period the war was ongoing, diving deeper into the specifics of war. I also hope to use this webpage to showcase my research and Computer Science knowledge as it grows.
